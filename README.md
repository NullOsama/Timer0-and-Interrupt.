# Timer0-and-Interrupt.
Configuring the Timer0 modules for a specific time generation.

# Requirments:

  **A.** For the circuit illustrated in figure 1, and using Timer0 module, write a MikroC code which allow the timer module to generate
         a square wave signal at PORTD.RD0 with a frequency of 250 Hz & 50% Duty cycle. Display your result on an oscilloscope.<br/>
  **B.** Repeat Part A, but change the duty cycle to 70%.<br/>
  
  **All circuits, flowCharts and calculations are provided.**
